# StreamTools

This was originally a Java app that I rewrote in Python. The original Java app was written in like 5 minutes and was a simple program to grab a random file based on a macro from touch portal.

This version is one part me practicing with Python, one part upgrading the original, one part getting back into development, and one part "it seemed like a fun project to do".
