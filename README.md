# StreamTools

This was originally a Java app that I rewrote in Python. The original Java app was written in like 5 minutes and was a simple program to grab a random file based on a macro from touch portal.

This version is one part me practicing with Python, one part upgrading the original, one part getting back into development, and one part "it seemed like a fun project to do".

I might not finish it, but hey, I tried.

At the very least, I'm going to get it working, clean up the code, and then do some security hardening on it. After that, who knows- it'll be fun to think of stuff to add.
